Limitations of __is_a

- does not work for actual parameters passed in varargs

- does not work for address-taken temporaries

- slow for on-stack data

- slow (currently) for static data

- programmer-facing interface is quirky: can't use type declarators directly

- equivalent named types defined in different source locations are wrongly distinguished

- typedefs need some extra handling (but doable in principle, straight from debug info)


Limitations of trumptr

- only instruments casts

- ... so misses implicit strengthenings of void*, even in C99

- ... misses more for C89, -fpermissive, ...
(TODO: fix this by using CIL's C++ifying transformation to insert casts)


Limitations of uniqtypes

- dlsym() requires string comparison

- slow for dynamically loaded code --- need to call helper to merge in uniqtypes

- slow for indirect call sites --- need to call helper to discover allocated types

- requires manual identification of alloc sites (--alloc-fn) (*)

- assume stable load addresses (cf. randomization?)



Limitations of heap_index_hooks

- requires manual instrumentation of external allocators

- requires manual identification of malloc wrappers (which must pass through return addrs) (a.k.a. *)

- current trailer-based implementation is vulnerable to trashing by overrun

- current size-increment implementation causes clownshoes bugs
