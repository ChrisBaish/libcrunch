Correctness / usability to-do:

fix the incomplete types bug (requires CIL fix)

use the uniqtype cache word to actually do some caching

relaxations for higher-order checks
- function pointer wrappers? hmm...
- mprotect() for write-through-void** and similar cases?
- check-on-use instrumentation

multithreaded programs: walking other threads' stacks

multithreaded programs: lock-free memtable algs

namespace-aware typestrs
*** issue with struct/union/enum tags: 
    same decl in C++ and C will get different names; bad? YES
    HMM does/could extern "C" help us? -- so 
        C checking casts of allocations made by C++: 
            no extern C involved, so no
            SO: create aliases where sensible?
            E.g. alias a C++ typedesc name by its C equiv where unambiguous
        C++ checking casts of allocations made by C: 
            could propagate extern-Cness of certain type definitions
            then generate C-style names for them
            though DWARF doesn't record extern-Cness
